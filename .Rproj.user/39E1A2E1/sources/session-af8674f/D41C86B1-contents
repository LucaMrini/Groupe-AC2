# 2.2 Data wrangling and cleaning

## 2.2.1 Ballon d'or winners clean

Now, it's time to clean up the Ballon d'Or database. This was less difficult than the previous database, although it still required some work. The *dplyr* and *readr* libraries were used during this data wrangling exercise. First, we needed to filter our database to keep only the winners from the last 20 years. This choice was made to observe the evolution of 21st-century football. It's important to note that there was no Ballon d'Or awarded in 2020, hence its absence. To do this, nothing was more efficient than using a *filter()* function.

Next, we encountered a naming issue with a certain player. For some reason, Luka ModriÄ‡ was listed as 'Croatia Luka Modric' so it was necessary to rename him using the *mutate()* function in conjunction with *ifelse()*.

Now, we could start adding new columns that would be useful for the project's analysis. We aimed to add the following columns: **Age, Height, Weight, PreferredFoot, and PreferredPositions**.

To achieve this, we needed other databases to join the missing columns. We chose FIFA05 and FIFA21 databases because the oldest winners are not present in the most modern game. To maximize our chances of having the necessary variables, we opted for two databases. To join two databases, we needed a common key. The **Player** column was the most suitable, so we aligned this name in the other databases using the *rename()* function. Having a common key allowed us to merge the databases using the *left_join()* function. However, this resulted in numerous unnecessary columns in our database. Using the *select()* function, we retained only the necessary columns. This process will be repeated while writing the code.

New challenges arose. For the sake of our analysis, we needed new columns. Firstly, an **Age** column. We now had the birth date and wanted the age at the time of winning. As some players won multiple times, they needed different ages for each success. Therefore, retrieving age from other databases wasn't feasible; we had to do it ourselves. We used the *sub()* function to extract the birth year and then, with *mutate()*, created the **Age** column by subtracting the birth year from the Ballon d'Or's year.

Next, to replace missing values in our columns, we used a combination of *\$* and *ifelse(is.na())* functions. *\$* was used to select the database and column we wanted to work on, while the latter function replaced missing values. Consequently, our columns were filled with values from the two external databases.

However, we encountered an issue with the player **Kaka**, who had missing values for some columns. As he was the only player with this problem, we manually created a *Kaka_values \<- c()* containing the different characteristics and used this in an *ifelse()* function to replace the missing values.

Before finishing and selecting only the useful columns, we needed to standardize the **PreferredFoot** and **PreferredPositions** columns. **PreferredFoot** sometimes had values like *R* instead of *Right*, and **PreferredPositions** had '-' instead of '/'. The *ifelse()* and *gsub()* functions were instrumental in this process.

Now, the Ballon d'Or database is cleaned up with the columns we intend to use for the analysis ahead.

```{r Ballon dor winners clean}
tibble(Variables = c("Year","Player","Country","Team","Age","Height","Weight","PreferredFoot","PreferredPositions"),
Meaning = c("Birthdate of the player","Name of the player","Country of origin of the player ","Team of the player","Age of the player","Height of the player","Weight of the player","Preferred foot of the player","Preferred posiiton of the player")) %>%
   kableExtra::kbl()%>%

  kableExtra::column_spec(1:2, color = "black")

```

## 2.2.2 Data of players clean

Cleaning up the database of player performances and statistics was a very complex task. Several types of problem arose, and we had to make choices and take initiatives for the rest of our analysis.

The *dplyr*, *readr, stringr, tidyr and lubridate* libraries were used during this data wrangling exercise.

Firstly, when we downloaded our database, a major problem appeared. As soon as a player or team name contained a special character such as an acute accent, the accent changed to **?** and we realized that we had an encoding problem. To overcome this problem, we tested different encoding, in particular *'UTF-8'*, and others *'ISO'*, but the problem didn't go away. In fact, some names ended up with the wrong accent. Nevertheless, we found that the *'ISO-8859-1'* encoding was the most suitable, leaving us with a problem with Slavic and ex-Yugoslav family names in particular. We therefore tried to create a list of players with the remaining encoding problem.

Understanding that special characters were indeed very special for these players, we took the initiative of manually renaming certain players such as *"Edin DÅ¾eko"*, using the *sub()* function, and then using the *gsub()* function, we replaced the last **?** with the letter **Ä‡**, which was generally the letter most present in names with this problem. However, for some reason, the players *"DuÅ¡an VlahoviÄ‡"* and *"Nikola VlaÅ¡iÄ‡"* had spaces instead of the letter **"Å¡"**, so we had to use another method to rename them. We used the *ifelse()* function, and as it wasn't possible to rename them using the basic written name, we had to use another common key: **Rk**.

It was important first to explain how we renamed our players and teams in the first place, as this was a major problem. However, before beginning the steps above, we first sorted the database a little. First of all, we had duplicate players because, as our database covers an entire season, it's quite normal to have transfers in mid-season, which explains the presence of duplicate players with different characteristics such as the club. The *distinct()* function allows us to remove duplicates.

Next, we had to filter the database for various reasons. For the rest of our analysis, certain columns will be important, such as the **Goals** column. However, when we were still getting to know our database, we noticed that this column produced some surprising results. In fact, this column represents the number of goals per 90 minutes, but some players had crazy statistics. *Pablo Sarabia*, for example, scored 5 goals every 90 minutes. The problem was that *Sarabia* hadn't played many minutes (22). We therefore realized that players who had been effective but had played few minutes would have disproportionately high statistics, because their statistics would then be weighted against the 90 minutes that our database covers.

So, using the *filter()* function, we took the initiative of only keeping players who had played at least 9 matches **(MP \>= 9)** and who had played at least 405 minutes **(Min \>= 405)**. This choice was made because we assumed that our players had to have played at least half the matches in half a season, because as we said, some players were transferred during the middle of the season. Moreover, in terms of minutes, we wanted them to have played at least one half of the 9 matches they played (45 minutes), and by multiplying that by the number of matches, we arrived at our figures. Thus, we only want to keep the attacking players, so those whose positions begin with the letter **'F'** for Forward.

Now that the database has been filtered, we are missing two columns for the rest of our project: **Height** and **Weight**. To do this, we decided to take a database from the FIFA21 game, the year of our statistics, which had the missing characteristics. However, here too we encountered a number of problems.

Firstly, we needed a common key to join the two databases. To do this, *rename()* allowed us to rename **Name** to **Player** and then, thanks to *left_join()*, the two databases were joined. Now we needed to see which players didn't have values for **Height** and **Weight**, so we created a *height_na* list using *filter(is.na())*. So 85 players had missing values. For a start, we could have players who simply didn't have the same spelling, for example *Sehrou/Serhou Guirassy* depending on the database. Then there was the fact that the FIFA21 database had full names, meaning that some players had their 2nd and 3rd first names included, something that was not in our database. Finally, there were some players who simply didn't appear in the game.

To overcome these problems, we tried various solutions. The one we kept was to separate the **Player** column into **Surname** and **Name**, using *separate()*, in order to be able to search and fill in via the **Name** common key. The problem with this solution was that we now had duplicates that we had to remove. This solution enabled us to reduce the number of missing values to 50.

A final attempt was to use several common keys at the same time. To do this, we needed the year of birth and the team in which the player plays. Once we had made sure we had these common keys, a new *left_join()* with a *by = c("Born", "Squad")* inside was used, and we could try to fill in the missing NAs. This choice of common keys was made on the assumption that if we only had strikers, it was quite possible that the strikers in the same team would differ in age, which would help us to maximise our chances of replacements. That's how we got down to 38 values.

However, we realized that it would be too complex to find the last missing values. So we stopped and looked at our *height_na* and realized that most of these players via the **Goals** column would not interest us for the rest of our analysis. We therefore took the initiative of manually replacing the **Height** and **Weight** of the best player from the **Goals** column for each of the 5 leagues, using *mutate()*, in order to keep players who might be of interest to us for the analysis. For the rest of the players, we decided to remove them from our database using *filter(!is.na())*.

It was now necessary to re-join **Surname** and **Name** as **Player** to avoid NAs filling up in one of the columns because of Brazilian players, for example, who are only called by their name.

Before concluding, you should know that in our analysis we want to compare the statistical and physical trends between the different leagues. So, to finish with this database, we wanted to create 5 different databases in order to have the players in each league, and to do this we had to create *"comp_players"* using the *filter()* function. We now have the databases we need to approach the various remaining stages of this project.

```{r Data of players clean}
tibble(Variables = c("Rk","Player","Nation", "Pos", "Squad", "Comp","Born", "Mp", "Min", "Goals", "SoT%", "G/Sh", "ShoDist", "PasTotAtt","PasTotCmp%", "Assists","PPA","CrsPA","SCA","GCA","GcaDrib","Press%","DriAtt","DriSucc%","Fld","AERwon%","Height","Weight"), Meaning = c("Rank of the player","Player's name","Player's nation","Position","Squad's name","League that squad occupies","Year of birth","Matches played","Minutes played","Goals scored or allowed","Shots on target percentage (Does not include penalty kicks)","Goals per shot","Average distance, in yards, from goal of all shots taken (Does not include penalty kicks)","Passes attempted","Pass completion percentage","Assists","Completed passes into the 18-yard box","Completed crosses into the 18-yard box","Shot-creating actions","Goal-creating actions","Successful dribbles that lead to a goal"," Percentage of time the squad gained possession withing five seconds of applying pressure","Dribbles attempted","Percentage of dribbles completed successfully","Fouls drawn","Percentage of aerials won","Height of the player","Weight of the player"))%>%

## 2.2.3 Data Clubs and others clean

ex :

```{r data clubs}
tibble(Variables = c(	"Player",	"Nation",	"GDP",	"Population",	" Pro Players ",	"Comp"	,"Revenue Comp/league",	"TV Rights Comp",	"Squad"), Meaning = c("Name of player","Nationality of player","GDP of Nation","ation's Population","Registered Pro Players by Nation","competition's name","Revenue of competition/league","revenue of tv rights by comp/league","Squad's name"))%>%
  kableExtra::kbl()%>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center")%>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(1:2, color = "black")

```

-   Spotting mistakes and missing data (could be part of EDA too)
-   Listing anomalies and outliers (could be part of EDA too)
