# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Overview and Motivation

This is a project analyzing the factors influencing the performance of football players in a key position. Here's how it all began:

The choice of sport, and football in particular, was a natural one. With football being the best-known and most practiced sport, it was not surprising that everyone in our group was at least a little interested in it. Moreover, one of our members has been passionate about the sport since childhood. Having played in clubs for over 10 years and watched a lot of matches every week, he thought it would be beneficial for a project of this scale to put his knowledge to good use in a subject that has always interested him thus combining passion with academic work: Data in the world of sport.

Nowadays, data has taken on an enormous importance in this sport, allowing some of the more economically modest teams to maintain a certain level by picking interesting players in lower leagues and, of course, at a lower cost. There are many examples of this: Toulouse FC in France and Brentford FC in England to name but a few. The fact that you can use statistics to compensate for a lack of resources is such an interesting subject. Another inspiration for our subject comes from outside football. The presence of data in sport has also enabled the world of cinema to bring out "Moneyball", starring Brad Pitt, showing how the Oakland Athletics baseball team managed to build a highly competitive team despite having more modest resources than the other big franchises, thanks to a method known as sabermetrics. The fact that we have a film that in some way demonstrates the process used to improve a team through statistics is a real plus, and has enabled us to ask ourselves the following question: what common characteristics do the best players in the striker's position have, for example? The existence of websites like "fantasy football leagues" or sports betting sites, in a way, necessitates having databases of various statistics related to player performance, such as the number of shots on target, successful passes, and so on. Therefore, it is an advantage because we have access to a plethora of different databases containing various statistics, which alleviates some of the burden of searching for a sufficiently large database for this project.

## 1.2 Project Objectives

Working on player performance statistics, it is interesting to see which statistics are important for different positions and especially between different leagues. From experience, we can say that, for example, English football is much more physical than the German league. Does it necessarily mean that our striker needs to be over 1.90 meters tall and have a certain weight to score a lot of goals? Additionally, of course, each team plays with a different system and strategy. Nevertheless, could we extract meaningful statistics within a position that in some way show a need to excel in a specific statistic? These kinds of questions set our goals and also allow us to put ourselves in the shoes of a data analyst within a club, demonstrating the complexity of the work but, more importantly, the ability to study the process by which a player is recruited based on their statistics and whether there is a way to predict their individual success and, beyond that, their importance in the collective success of their team. We decided to focus on a key position (striker), and on the characteristics chosen to be 'limited' because, as an outsider, we obviously don't have all the possible factors influencing performance that a real data analyst would have, so this allows us to imagine an opening for future work due to the enormity of the resources in this area and it obviously shows the complexity of such a profession.

Thus, the objective would be to identify the most significant statistics for a key position, allowing us to visualize the crucial skills required to maximize a player's potential success during a transfer. The advantage would then be to find a way to predict this success.

## 1.3 Research questions

On an individual performance level:

-   Among the top goal scorers in the top 5 leagues, what are the common factors and statistics that are significant, and how it evolves depending on the championship?

-   What are the main physical factors influencing the goals per short on target (90')?

-   What specific statistics consistently distinguish Ballon d'Or winners from other top players, and how have these trends evolved over the past decades?

On an economic level:

-   How different cultural and economic indicators, such as a footballer's nationality, his country's GDP or his club revenue influence his individual performance and the overall performance of his team?

# 2 Data

## 2.1 Raw Datasets

### 2.1.1

## 2.2 Data Wrangling

### 2.2.1 Data Wrangling: Players clean

### 2.2.2 Data Wrangling: Ballon d'Or clean

Now, it's time to clean up the Ballon d'Or database. This was less difficult than the previous database, although it still required some work. The *dplyr* and *readr* libraries were used during this data wrangling exercise. First and foremost, we needed to filter our database to keep only the winners from the last 20 years. This choice was made to observe the evolution of 21st-century football. It's important to note that there was no Ballon d'Or awarded in 2020, hence its absence. To do this, nothing was more efficient than using a *filter()* function.

Next, we encountered a naming issue with a certain player. For some reason, Luka ModriÄ‡ was listed as 'Croatia Luka Modric,' so it was necessary to rename him using the *mutate()* function in conjunction with *ifelse()*.

Now, we could start adding new columns that would be useful for the project's analysis. We aimed to add the following columns: Age, Height, Weight, PreferredFoot, and PreferredPositions.

To achieve this, we needed other databases to join the missing columns. We chose FIFA05 and FIFA21 databases because the oldest winners are not present in the most modern game. To maximize our chances of having the necessary variables, we opted for two databases. To join two databases, we needed a common key. The **Player** column was the most suitable, so we aligned this name in the other databases using the *rename()* function. Having a common key allowed us to merge the databases using the *left_join()* function. However, this resulted in numerous unnecessary columns in our database. Using the *select()* function, we retained only the necessary columns. This process will be repeated while writing the code.

New challenges arose. For the sake of our analysis, we needed new columns. Firstly, an **Age** column. We now had the birth date and wanted the age at the time of winning. As some players won multiple times, they needed different ages for each success. Therefore, retrieving age from other databases wasn't feasible; we had to do it ourselves. We used the *sub()* function to extract the birth year and then, with *mutate()*, created the **Age** column by subtracting the birth year from the Ballon d'Or's year.

Next, to replace missing values in our columns, we used a combination of *\$* and *ifelse(is.na())* functions. *\$* was used to select the database and column we wanted to work on, while the latter function replaced missing values. Consequently, our columns were filled with values from the two external databases.

However, we encountered an issue with the player **Kaka**, who had missing values for some columns. As he was the only player with this problem, we manually created a *Kaka_values \<- c()* containing the different characteristics and used this in an *ifelse()* function to replace the missing values.

Before finishing and selecting only the useful columns, we needed to standardize the **PreferredFoot** and **PreferredPositions** columns. **PreferredFoot** sometimes had values like *R* instead of *Right*, and **PreferredPositions** had '-' instead of '/'. The *ifelse()* and *gsub()* functions were instrumental in this process.

Now, the Ballon d'Or database is cleaned up with the columns we intend to use for the analysis ahead.

# 3 EDA

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
